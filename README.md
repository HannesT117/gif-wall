# 🥳🍾🥂 gif-wall 🎉🎁🎈

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

If you need a hacky but effective way to show fullscreen gifs, this is your project.
The code has mostly been implemented just before a party for exactly this use case.
Bugs are part of the program to enhance the experience.
The website has an uptime guarantuee of 0%.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000?q=party](http://localhost:3000?q=party) with your browser to see the result.

You can change the query parameter to display gifs about a different topic. When using multiple terms, use a comma-separated list.
Example: [http://localhost:3000?q=party,celebration,cats](http://localhost:3000?q=party,celebration,cats)

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and add values for the keys listed.
There is a more specific desription for every key in `.env.template`.
